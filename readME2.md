Creating a large program that uses data structure and algorithm concepts in Python can be complex and is best understood through a step-by-step process. Let's consider an example of a program that involves various data structures and algorithms. We'll build a library management system that allows the user to:

Add a new book.
Remove a book.
Search for a book by title.
Borrow a book.
Return a book.
List all books.
List borrowed books.
To achieve this, we'll use the following data structures and algorithms:

Hash Table for quick book lookup by title.
Linked List to maintain the order of books.
Queue for managing the borrow/return operations.
Here's a comprehensive program:
